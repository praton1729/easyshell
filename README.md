## PSH(praton shell)

- This is a basic shell as of now.
- Currently it offers basic shell utilities like cd. More to be added soon.
- Currently piping is not supported.
- Currently redirection is not supported.
- Currently regular expression is not supported.

## Final Aim

- To create a bootstrappable shell which can be easily added to any application.
- So that this can be reused.
- The user would just need to create a configuration file.
- Need to invest more time on the design.
